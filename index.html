<!-- <p><strong>About.</strong> I strive for understanding complex social and behavioral phenomena. To this end, I'm studying towards my PhD in <code>computational social science</code> (<a href="http://css.gmu.edu/">CSS</a>) in the department of Computational &amp; Data Sciences (<a href="https://cos.gmu.edu/cds/academic-programs/">CDS</a>) at George Mason University (<a href="https://www.gmu.edu/">GMU</a>). Given that most social problems are complex, I believe that integration of a variety of theoretical tools in developing new social theories or testing the existing ones make them stronger. Besides, the digital revolution gives us the opportunity to trace and measure what is unobservable before, thus has the potential to provide empirical base in understanding some social phenomena better; but making sense of these "big data" has its own challenges, and requires new skills. In this regard, I educate myself in new computational and quantitative methods to address social scientific inquiries in the most appropriate ways. These methods that I employ in my research can be grouped into four: (1) social information retrieval and data analysis, (2) social complexity and network analysis, (3) social simulation and agent-based modeling, and (4) online crowdsourcing and experimentation.</p>

  <strong>Bio.</strong>
  
Talha got his PhD in Computational Social Science from George Mason University and has worked on two People Analytics companies as a Data Scientist. During his graduate studies, he worked in the Center for Social Complexity and Machine Learning and Inference Lab, and has published papers in venues like SBP-BRIMS (International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling & Prediction and Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation).
<br>
At Humanyze, an MIT Media Lab spinoff, Talha designed new systems, algorithms, and metrics to reveal how work gets done in teams and organizations, using face-to-face and digital communication metadata collected from wearable sensors, IoT devices, as well as from workplace communication and collaboration tools such as calendar, Skype, and email. The theories and methods on which his algorithms rely were primarily from the fields of organizational behavior and social network analysis.
<br>
Talha joined BetterWorks as their first data scientist and developed several machine learning models to be used in the product. His competency prediction model accepts a feedback text and identifies the competencies discussed in the text as well as their contexts (whether the competency is a strength of or opportunity for the feedback receiver). In another project Talha developed a solution to infer the topics and sentiments of free-text survey responses.

  <strong>At Amazon.</strong>
  I have completed several projects at Amazon: <ul>
    <li>Led to $31M+/yr increase in profits (as revealed by experiment results) by improving the main algorithm used in email marketing (productionized)</li>
    <li>Calculated the cost of opting out from emails (and push notifications) using Double ML & propensity score matching; and integrated it into our marketing program valuation model (Spark Scala, AWS Step functions)</li>
    <li>Built NN-based push tap propensity model that outperformed & replaced the production model (PyTorch, Sagemaker)</li>
    <li>Mentored an Applied Scientist intern to build a click propensity model (productionized)</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>At Betterworks.</strong>
  I have worked on four projects at Betterworks (in chronological order): <ul>
    <li>
      "Can we identify good employees with our data. If so, how?" was the CPO's question that started this project. I conceptualized and developed a PoC for the insights module based on Google's <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/" target="_blank">Project Aristotle</a>. I showed how Psychological Safety (the number one determinant of team effectiveness), and the other four factors can be modeled, modeled them, and shared the results.
    </li>
    <li>
      “How can we show the impact of our product on employee performance with our data?” The second project was about justifying the benefits of the product empirically to support the customers' ROI. I formed five hypotheses (employees that use our product properly/often have better goal progress) and tested them on our data. Some of the tests were simple statistical tests and correlations but I also applied some causal inference techniques such as differences in differences.
    </li>
    <li>
      “Given a feedback text, can you create a model that can identify the competencies of the feedback receiver and their contexts (strength/opportunity)?” I built a model that can identify the competencies in a feedback text with 89% precision and recall.
    </li>
    <li>
      "Given a free-text survey response, find its topic and sentiment." My topic model (40-class classifier) had about 86% precision and 99% recall. And I came up with a 3-class sentiment model solution that beat the old solution by 14%.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p><p>
  <strong>At Humanyze.</strong> I worked as the computational social scientist (data scientist) and led the research area at Humanyze (a startup that was born out of Sandy Pentland's Human Dynamics group at MIT Media Lab). The main problem I was trying to solve is
    how to model the indicators of engagement of employees, productivity of teams, and adaptability of organizations using the metadata (no content) of the workplace technologies such as calendar, e-mail, Slack, etc., and sensors (if available). The theories and methods on which my algorithms rely are primarily from the fields of organizational behavior and social network analysis. My responsibilities include writing papers, collaborating with researchers, and supervising interns. Some of my research output: <ul>
    <li><a href="https://osf.io/hjre6/">Exploring the Impact of Mandatory Remote Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic (Oz and Crooks, 2020).</a> Using workplace communication metadata, I examined the heterogeneous effects of mandatory remote work. Presented this work at <a href="http://sbp-brims.org/">SBP-BRIMS</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://osf.io/wxcqp/">Digital Trails of Work Stressors (Oz, 2020)</a>. This paper proposes a strategy with which stressor measurement becomes less disruptive and more cost effective. My solution oriented paper (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0015">Watts, 2017</a>) has been accepted to <a href="http://sbp-brims.org/">SBP-BRIMS</a>, and gives a sense of my work at Humanyze.</li>

<p><strong>At George Mason University.</strong> While studying towards my <a href="http://css.gmu.edu">PhD in Computational Social Science</a> with <a href="https://www.gisagents.org/">Andrew Crooks</a> I was a graduate research assistant in the <a href="https://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu/">Center for Social Complexity</a> (one year) and <a href="https://mli.gmu.edu/">Machine Learning and Inference Lab</a> (for five years). My work there includes:
